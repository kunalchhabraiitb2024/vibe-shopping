## Recent Fixes & Improvements

### âœ… Consistency Issues Resolved (June 2025)

**Problem**: The system was showing different numbers of recommendations (e.g., 4 vs 7 items) for the same query with identical filters, leading to inconsistent user experience.

**Root Cause**: 
- Non-deterministic sampling logic in `generate_enhanced_recommendations()` function
- Additional trending items being injected randomly
- Complex multi-step processing with varying fallback mechanisms

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Deterministic Selection**: Replaced complex sampling with consistent top-N selection
2. **Removed Random Elements**: Eliminated trending item injection that caused count variations  
3. **Accurate Justification**: Fixed justification messages to reflect actual final recommendation count
4. **Consistent Processing**: Streamlined recommendation generation to always produce same results for same input

**Result**: Same query now consistently returns same number of recommendations with accurate justification messages.

### âœ… Previous Fixes Maintained

- **Excel Migration**: Successfully switched from CSV to Excel file handling
- **JSON Syntax**: Fixed vibe mapping parsing errors (now loads 11 mappings vs 8)
- **Catalog Compatibility**: Smart AI-powered validation blocks unavailable items (coats, shoes, etc.)
- **Process Flow**: All queries now check catalog compatibility and reset state for incompatible requests
